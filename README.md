## Project Diablo 2 Season Rollbacks
A collection of season rollback archives for Project Diablo 2

Much of the credit for earlier season legwork goes to BetweenWalls and/or whomever he sourced the packs from.
The vast majority of this (Seasons 1 - 6) are snagged from his [PD2 Converter](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-Converter).

Current season will likely not be included until shortly before the following season's beta. If I were to do that, I would very much want to make a rollback for every patch that happens, which is much too unrealistic.

### Installation

For most reasonable use cases, though, just extracting the relevant zip  into your PD2 folder should be sufficient.

### Notes:
Some of the more dramatic season rollbacks will likely take a little more involved work to get to function.
I can't think of these steps off the top of my head, but will add instructions as I come across them again.

Starting with season 6, default config files will be included just to keep things consistent. Take note of this if your settings are different as you may need to change your settings again afterwards, depending on which season and config is used.
