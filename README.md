## Project Diablo 2 Season Rollbacks  
A collection of season rollback archives for Project Diablo 2

Much of the credit for earlier season legwork goes to BetweenWalls and/or whomever he sourced the packs from.  
The vast majority of this (Seasons 1 - 6) are snagged from his [PD2 Converter](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-Converter).

Current season will likely not be included until shortly before the following season's beta.

### Note:  
Some of the more dramatic season rollbacks will likely take a little more involved work to get to function.  
I can't think of these steps off the top of my head, but will add instructions as I come across them again.  
  
For most reasonable use cases, though, just extracting the relevant zip from the [Releases page](https://github.com/xkanzeon/PD2-rollbacks/releases) into your PD2 folder should be sufficient.
